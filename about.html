	<h2>What is DHRI?</h2>
	<p>The <a href ="http://dhinstitutes.org/about.html"> Digital Humanities Research Institute</a> (DHRI) was a ten-day residential workshop held in June 2018 at The Graduate Center, CUNY. During the DHRI, participants explored digital humanities research and teaching with leading DH scholars, developed core computational research skills through hands-on workshops, and began work on developing versions of the DHRI for their own communities. SMU Libraries' own Rafia Mirza attended the DHRI, and DHRI@SMU is a result of her experience.

	<h2>The DHRI Philosophy</h2>

	<p>We believe that all participants are experts in something, but none are experts in all areas. By fostering a collaborative, interdisciplinary environment where humanities research questions, methods, and values are most significant, we work to build a cooperative learning experience. We have established an approach that leverages participant’s strengths, disciplinary interests, and research interests.
       DHRI emphasizes foundational skills because we believe that it is the most effective path toward enabling digital humanities researchers to become self-teachers and mentors. This leads to second-and third-order effects as participants teach themselves and others, and provides a common vocabulary, skill set, and experience from which to form future collaborations.
            </p>
