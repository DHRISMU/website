      <p>2020 will be the second year of DHRI @ SMU! <i> DHRI@SMU is still happening this August and the application deadline has been extended to July 31st! After considering the learning and community building experience we have in mind for DHRI awhile keeping in mind best practices around physical distancing and public health considerations, we have decided to hold a remote DHRI this year. We have a plan to offer the same community oriented learning experience that will feature plenty of small group synchronous learning.</i> If you have an interest in this tremendous program, please apply.
        We seek participants from a diverse cross-section of academe, to ensure both interdisciplinarity and inter-institutional representation. </p>
        <p>The application includes an essay section. Please write no more than few paragraphs in response to each of the following prompts. Be sure to share information about your goals, interests, and needs.</p> 
          

      <ul>
          <li>Describe your research interests. Help us understand what type of digital projects might appeal to you.</li>
          <li>How will participating in DHRI benefit you personally, professionally, or pedagogically?</li>
          <li> Give an example of a technical issue you've experienced, and how you handled this problem. </li>
          <li>Provide examples of how you work collaboratively:  What roles do you naturally assume when working in a group? What roles have you taken on to ensure success of a project? How would you describe your contribution to the group dynamics? </li>
          </ul>
