          <li>How will participating in DHRI benefit you personally, professionally, or pedagogically?</li>
          <li> Give an example of a technical issue you've experienced, and how you handled this problem. </li>
          <li>Provide examples of how you work collaboratively:  What roles do you naturally assume when working in a group? What roles have you taken on to ensure success of a project? How would you describe your contribution to the group dynamics? </li>
          </ul>

        
      <p>Participants must commit to the full 4-day experience, including attending all workshops and events. <b><a class="text-blue" href ="https://smu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_03zro0eBjYOdYah">Click here to submit an application (appliction not yet open, check back Feb. 2020). </a></b></p>
